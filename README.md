Forecasting rainfall using climatic indicators is one of the best methods of meteorology, in many parts of the world. Since  Australia has different climates, we can use it for better education. In this project, I review and analyze data, related to Australia's climate that was prepared during ten years. This data is related to different cities. We chose  Albury city and we set our goal to predict the amount of precipitation (Rainfall). The data frame has 14 columns.
